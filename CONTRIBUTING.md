## üìú **Code of Conduct**

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/creator-chapter.git
   cd creator-chapter
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```
4. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env.local
   # Fill in your Supabase credentials
   ```
5. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## üîÑ **Development Process**

We use GitHub Flow, so all code changes happen through Pull Requests:

1. **Create a branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. **Make your changes** following our code style guidelines
3. **Test your changes** thoroughly
4. **Commit your changes** using semantic commit messages
5. **Push to your fork** and create a Pull Request

### **Branch Naming Convention**
- `feature/description` - for new features
- `fix/description` - for bug fixes
- `docs/description` - for documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - for code refactoring
- `test/description` - for adding tests

### **Commit Message Format**
We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(auth): add social login support
fix(dashboard): resolve data loading issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## üîÄ **Pull Request Process**

1. **Update documentation** if you've changed APIs or added features
2. **Add tests** for new functionality
3. **Ensure all tests pass**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run lint
   ```
4. **Update the changelog** if needed
5. **Request review** from maintainers
6. **Address feedback** and update your PR

### **PR Requirements**
- ‚úÖ All tests pass
- ‚úÖ ESLint rules pass
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compiles without errors
- ‚úÖ Code coverage doesn't decrease
- ‚úÖ Documentation is updated
- ‚úÖ Semantic commit messages
- ‚úÖ No merge conflicts

## üé® **Code Style**

We use ESLint and TypeScript to enforce code style:

### **TypeScript Guidelines**
- Use strict mode (configured in `tsconfig.json`)
- Avoid `any` types - use proper interfaces
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add type annotations for complex types

### **React Guidelines**
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices for performance
- Use proper error boundaries
- Implement accessibility features

### **File Organization**
- Group related files in directories
- Use barrel exports (`index.ts`) for clean imports
- Separate concerns (components, hooks, services)
- Keep components small and focused

### **Styling Guidelines**
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Maintain consistent spacing and colors
- Use shadcn/ui components when possible

## üß™ **Testing**

We use Vitest and Testing Library for testing:

### **Running Tests**
```bash
npm test                # Run all tests
npm run test:ui         # Run tests with UI
npm run test:coverage   # Run tests with coverage
```

### **Writing Tests**
- Write tests for all new features
- Test user interactions, not implementation details
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies

### **Test Structure**
```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  it('should render correctly', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should handle user interaction', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

## üêõ **Reporting Bugs**

### **Bug Report Template**

## Additional Context
Any other context about the problem.
```

### **Before Reporting**
- Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
